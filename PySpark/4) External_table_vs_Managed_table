External Table vs Internal Table 

what is external table ?
> when we are storing data in database then we there are two data created 
1) Table data 
2)Meta data 
  > Meta data is nothing but the schema of the table and information about the table 

> so in the external taboe only the meta data is created, and what about the data in the table ? the data is present some where else so we are just accessing 
the data by path we're not importing any data 
can we do any update or delete on this file 

> when we use insert to insert records so new file in the hdfs will be created we can't update or delete 


Managed Table is simple 
>  Here data is imported into the Table and meta data is also created.

External Table :

create table <table name> <constraints> use csv location <path>

Internal Table:

create table <table name> <constraints> using csv
