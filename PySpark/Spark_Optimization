Spark Optimization
=======================

Performance tunning 

1.application code level optimization
> for example we can use canche, use reduceByKey insted of groupByKey 

2. cluster level Optimization
> containers/executors...

out main aim is to reduce the time of computation, we can reduce the cost of the code by optimization

how can we reduce the time with limited resources like making some optimizations
how can we reduce the time from 10 mins execution to 5 mins some things like this 
===============================================================================

Resources level
resources - memory(RAM),CPU cores(Compute)

we have node we call it as working nodes 

so suppose we have 10 working nodes then each node is having like 
64 RAM 
16 core cpu 


Executors 
> Executor is like a container which holds the resources 
> 1 node can hold many executors 

How many exe can be created in one node ?

16Cores, 64 gb RAM 

there are 2 Choice for creating containers 

1. thin executors - Minimal resources possible 

we can get 16 exectors with power of 1 core and 4gb RAM


> Drawback  In this option we lose multi treading in this option 
> A lot of copies of broadcast variable are requried each executor should recive its own way 

2. Fat  executors - 
---------------------
To give maximum resources to each executors 

16 cores 64 gb RAM 

we can create the executors with 16 cores and 64 gb RAM

> it is observed if executors hold more than 5 cores then the hdfs throughput suffers (lot of multiple treading)
>If the executos hold huge amount of memory then garbage collection takes time
